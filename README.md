# Titanic Survival Classification

This project aims to analyze and classify the survivors based on a dataset that includes various features such as 'PassengerId', 'Survived', 'Pclass', 'Name', 'Sex', 'Age', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Ticket', 'Fare', 'Cabin', and 'Embarked'. These features provide insights into the demographic composition, family relationships, ticket class, fare paid, and embarkation point of the passengers.

The primary goal is to investigate how these factors correlate with the likelihood of survival. By employing machine learning classification techniques, we seek to discern patterns and relationships within the data to understand the influence of each feature on survival outcomes.
